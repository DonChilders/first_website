<h3>“Critics are like eunuchs – they know how, but they can’t do it.” –Paul Bocuse</h3>
<div class="boxed">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bocuse" target="_blank">Paul Bocuse</a>, French chef and restaurateur known for introducing and championing a lighter style of cooking.
Scion of a long line of restaurateurs, Bocuse apprenticed under several prominent chefs before taking over the family’s failing hotel-restaurant in Collonges, near Lyon, in 1959. Before long he had attracted much attention with his innovative nouvelle cuisine, a style of cooking that emphasized lightly cooked vegetables, sparing use of dressings and sauces made from materials low in fats, and artfully simple presentation. Bocuse’s abandonment of many conventions of traditional grande cuisine won many followers among younger chefs, and nouvelle cuisine soon appeared in many variants, especially in France and the United States. Bocuse’s own restaurant was rated three stars by the influential Guide Michelin.<br>His most famous dish was <a href="https://www.allmychefs.com/recipes/soup-with-truffles_923_2" target="_blank">truffle soup</a>, a hardy mixture of truffles and foie gras in chicken broth, baked in a single-serving bowl covered in puff pastry. First served at a dinner at the Élysée Palace in 1975, the soup was named for the French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who had just awarded Mr. Bocuse the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour" target="_blank"> French Legion of Honor</a> .
